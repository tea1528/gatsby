## 2017
I had gone through a lot in 2017. I finally came back to the university after 2 years of military service. I had done a summer internship at Cyberport HK and I also won [CodeIT Suisse](https://www.credit-suisse.com/careers/en/career-opportunities/recruitment-technology-microsite/technology-buzz/launch-2017-codeit-suisse.html), a algorithm plus coding competition and earned the highest points in APAC region.
I've gone through several interviews for Investment Banks in Hong Kong. After a series of interview, I was finally accepted to [Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/people-opportunities/students-graduates/programs/technology/summer-analyst-asia-pacific) as a summer analyst and will be joining the technology team.  

## So it's 2018...
On the first day of 2018, I took a 15 hours long flight to US. It's been almost 7 years since last visited North America. I am currently on semester exchange to [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/) which is located in Nashville, US. It has been three weeks since I arrived here and lot has happened. I am taking some interesting Computer courses that heavily uses Github unlike HKUST. I also joined a [research project](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/aivaslab/) here in Vanderbilt and will be learning more about machine learning. I will write an another post about my project in the future.

## My Resolution
<ul>
  <li>
    Since I am on exchange and have more time compared to previous semester, I plan to
    write more on this blog and share some of the topics that I am interested in.
  </li>
  <li>
    In addition, I hope to get a hands on Cracking the Coding Interview book that I bought last year so that I can prepare for upcoming technical interviews for the summer.

  <li>
    Lastly, I plan to prepare for GRE starting from April so that I can take the exam over the summer.
